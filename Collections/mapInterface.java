 * The Map interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework.
 * It represents a mapping between a set of keys and their corresponding values.
 * A Map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
 * The Map interface is used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique,
 * and it provides an efficient way to retrieve, update, and manipulate data based on keys.
