/*
 * The Map interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework.
 * It represents a mapping between a set of keys and their corresponding values.
 * A Map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
 * The Map interface is used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique,
 * and it provides an efficient way to retrieve, update, and manipulate data based on keys.
 *
 * No Duplicate Keys
 *
 * HashMap - HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
 * LinkedHashMap - LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
 * TreeMap - TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order.
