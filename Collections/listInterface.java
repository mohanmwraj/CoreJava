 * boolean hasPrevious() - The method returns true if this list iterator has more elements while traversing the list in the reverse direction.
 * E previous() - The method returns the previous element in the list and moves the cursor position backward.
 * E previousIndex() - The method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to previous().
